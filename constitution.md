# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM INTERIM CONSTITUTION

## INTRODUCTORY NOTES

This is an Interim Constitution.  

It is intended to be temporary.  

The Final Constitution must be ratified by the Cardano community.  

Such ratification is expected to occur at the end of 2024 or the beginning of 
2025.  

Therefore, the Final Constitution may differ, potentially significantly from 
this Interim Constitution based on the desires of the Cardano community.  

However, given that on-chain governance will come into existence during 2024, 
requiring a robust constitution and constitutional committee, before the Final 
Constitution has been ratified, this Interim Constitution must be sufficiently 
robust and wholesome to support the needs and requirements of CIP-1694, assuring
that the principles identified in this Interim Constitution are not compromised, 
until the date on which the Final Constitution is ratified.

In approaching this Interim Constitution, it must be remembered that this is not
a constitution for only a blockchain but rather, it is a constitution for a 
blockchain ecosystem–a much more ambitious endeavor.  

Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important, is 
not the sole focus of this Interim Constitution.  

Rather, this Interim Constitution provides the basis and fundamental framework 
through which all actors in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem can come together 
to govern themselves and form radically new approaches to human interaction and 
collaboration.  

By necessity, this Interim Constitution recognizes the role of and empowers the 
Constitutional Committee, confirms the right of the Cardano community to form 
collective bodies for collaboration and governance, and empowers DReps to act as 
the voice of ADA holders.  

The Interim Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to 
and the use of funds of the Cardano treasury during a bootstrapping phase 
through the inclusion of the Cardano Guardrails in this Interim Constitution.

## PREAMBLE

In the beginning of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem, three pioneering entities,
IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, came together to foster the 
establishment of a new blockchain, the Cardano Blockchain, laying the foundation 
for a decentralized network that would empower individuals, promote 
collaboration, and foster innovation.  

Their pioneering efforts have shaped the path for a blockchain designed to 
ensure a fair and transparent environment where all participants can contribute 
to the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem's growth and success.

Over time, the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem has expanded significantly, and now, 
the Cardano Community comprising thousands of ADA holders, individuals, builders
, developers, enterprises, stake pools, users of the Cardano Blockchain and 
others, operate in a truly decentralized manner, further strengthening the 
resilience and autonomy of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.  

As the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem continues to grow, it has become imperative 
to similarly adapt and evolve its governance model, reflecting the principles of
decentralization, community involvement, inclusivity and collaboration that have
been the cornerstone of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem since its start.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework, and one
that utilizes wherever possible blockchain technology in the governance process, 
the Cardano Community, as the members of this decentralized Cardano Blockchain 
Ecosystem, hereby establishes this Cardano Interim Constitution.  

It shall serve as a guiding set of principles for the operation and governance 
of our collective efforts, fostering an environment where all participants can 
contribute to the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem as a whole.

Together, the Cardano Community commits to uphold the principles enshrined in 
this Interim Constitution and to work together towards the continuous 
improvement, growth, and success of our decentralized blockchain ecosystem known 
as the Cardano Blockchain.

This Interim Constitution shall serve as the embodiment of the guiding 
principles for the operation and governance of the decentralized Cardano 
Blockchain Ecosystem, providing a foundation that will adapt and evolve over 
time to meet the continuing needs of the Cardano Community.  

All members of the Cardano Community are expected to abide by this Interim 
Constitution, actively participate in its governance processes, including 
completing a Final Constitution to be ratified by the Cardano Community, and 
work collaboratively towards the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem 
as a whole, contributing to its growth, sustainability, and success.

# APPENDIX I, CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

## 1.  INTRODUCTION

To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance pursuant to CIP-1694, it is 
necessary to establish sensible guardrails that will enable the Cardano 
Blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.  

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain 
on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters and 
limits on treasury withdrawals.  

These guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings, and 
recommendations that are based on experience, measurement and governance 
objectives.  

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of 
the Cardano Blockchain.  

They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid 
potential problems with security, performance or functionality.  

The expectation is that some of these guardrails will be encoded as part of 
future on-chain governance and, over time, will be enforced via scripts.

These guardrails apply to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment.  

They are not intended to apply to test environments or other blockchains that 
use the Cardano software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently.  

Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way.  

These interactions are addressed in this Appendix.  

While the guardrails in this Appendix presently represent the best technical 
advice, this Appendix should be treated as a living document. 

Implementation improvements, new simulation or performance evaluation results 
for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these 
guardrails to be relaxed in due course.  

The guardrails set forth in the Appendix may be amended from time to time as 
provided by the guardrails and as set forth in the Constitution and any future 
chains to these guardrails shall be recorded in future versions of this Appendix
.

## Terminology

**Should/Should not.**  Where this Appendix says that a value “should not” be 
set below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a recommendation 
or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion or alteration 
by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano Community in light of 
experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system or the operation of the 
Cardano Blockchain.

**Must/Must not.**  Where this Appendix says that a value “must not” be set 
below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a requirement that 
will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in 
mechanisms, and that if not followed could cause a protocol failure, security 
breach or other undesirable outcome.  

These guardrails may only be changed following an on-chain governance action 
resulting in a hard fork that has been approved based on an amendment to this 
Appendix in accordance with the Constitution.  

Such hard forks should only be undertaken following careful technical discussion 
and evaluation.

## Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")
A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when an Update to the 
Constitution or proposal policy governance action is enacted.  

This script is executed whenever a governance action is submitted on-chain.

**Scripts can only be applied to two types of governance action:**
1. Parameter Update actions, and
2. Treasury Withdrawal actions.

This avoids scenarios where a script could prevent the chain ever enacting a 
Hard Fork action, creating deadlock.

**Symbol and Explanation**
(y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.

(x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.

(~ - reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the reason 
given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

**Alternative Solutions**
Other policies or procedures are possible but need to be properly informed by 
technical concerns.  

Incorrectly changing some parameters could require disaster recovery procedures 
to be initiated.

## 2.  GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER SETTINGS

Below are guardrails and guidelines for changing protocol parameter settings 
such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result 
of making changes to parameter settings.  

Note that there are at least four different naming conventions in use when 
describing parameters.

1. The name used in the Genesis file
2. The name used in protocol parameter update governance actions
3. The name used internally in ledger rules
4. The name used in research papers

This Appendix covers protocol parameter governance actions under number 2 above.

### 2.1.  Critical Protocol Parameters

The bellow protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

**Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain**
* maximum block body size (maxBlockBodySize)
* maximum transaction size (maxValueSize)
* maximum block header size (maxBlockHeaderSize)
* maximum size of a serialized asset value (maxValueSize)
* maximum script execution units in a single block 
(maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps])
* minimum fee coefficient (txFeePerByte)
* minimum fee constant (txFeeFixed)
* minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO (utxoCostPerByte)
* governance action deposit (govDeposit)

#### Guardrails

[PARAM-01] (x) These parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: 
SPOs must say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active 
block production stake.

[PARAM-02] (x) At least 3 months should normally pass between the publication of 
an off-chain proposal and the submission of the corresponding on-chain 
governance action.  

This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a serious network issue following 
careful technical discussion and evaluation.

**Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System**

* delegation key Lovelace deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)
* pool registration Lovelace deposit (stakePoolDeposit)
* minimum fixed rewards cut for pools (minPoolCost)
* DRep deposit amount (drepDeposit)
* minimal Constitutional Committee size (committeeMinSize)
* maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members 
(committeeMaxTermLimit)
  
### Guardrails

[PARAM-03] (x) DReps must vote “yes” with a collective support of more than 50% 
of all active voting stake.  

This will be enforced by the voting thresholds.

[PARAM-04] (x) At least 3 months should normally pass between the publication of 
an off-chain proposal and the submission of the corresponding on-chain 
governance action.  

This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a serious network issue following 
careful technical discussion and evaluation.

### 2.2.  Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

1. Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem;
2. Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the Cardano 
Blockchain;
3. Ensure that Ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stakes in 
constructive ways, including when delegating Ada for block production; and
4. Balance economic demands for different user groups, including:
* Stake pool operators
* Ada holders
* DeFi users
* DApp developers
* Exchanges

**Triggers for Change:**
* Changes in the fiat value of Ada resulting in potential problems with security
, performance or functionality
* Changes in transaction volumes or types
* Community requests or suggestions
* Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters

**Counter-indicators:**
Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation.  They need 
to account for:
* External economic factors
* Network security concerns

**Core Metrics to be considered:**
* Ada value resulting in potential problems with security, performance or 
functionality
* Transaction volumes and types
* Number and health of stake pools
* External economic factors

**Changes to Specific Economic Parameters**
1. Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee 
(txFeeFixed)

Defines the cost for basic transactions in Lovelace:

fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)

#### Guardrails

[PARAM-05] (y) The transaction fee per byte must not be decreased below 30
* This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

[PARAM-06] (y) The transaction fee per byte must not be increased above 1000
* This ensures that transactions can be paid for
